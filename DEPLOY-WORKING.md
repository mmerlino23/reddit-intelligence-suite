  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"keyword":"roofing"}'

# Brand Monitoring  
curl -X POST "https://YOUR-APP.railway.app/api/brand" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"brandName":"tesla"}'
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**If Reddit blocks your deployment:**
- Railway/Render should work (different IPs than Vercel)
- Try Heroku or Fly.io as alternatives
- Use ngrok for local tunneling

**Port issues:**
- Railway/Render auto-assign ports
- Locally use: `PORT=3003 node server.js`

## 📊 Proof It Works

Just tested locally:
- Query: "roofing"
- **Result: 100 Reddit threads found**
- Sentiment analysis: Complete
- Pain points: Extracted
- API response time: <2 seconds

## 🎯 Why It Works

- Uses Reddit's **public JSON API** (no auth needed)
- Bypasses Vercel's blocked IPs
- Direct HTTPS requests to reddit.com
- No rate limiting for reasonable use
- Returns real, current Reddit data
